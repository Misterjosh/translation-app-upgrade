# translation-app-upgrade
I reworked an old group project. The changes are things I wanted to do and didn't have time for while in class.

## Description
This is a front end translation app. It uses **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, and the **Yandex and Google APIs**.

## Viewablility
You can find it at https://misterjosh.github.io/Project-1%20-translation-app/index.html in my Github Repository.

## Changes from the original
1. The first change I made was to remove the Giphy API request that generated a Gif between clicking the translate button and producing the results of the translation and book requests. 

2. Next, I refactored a lot of the JavaScript. I simplified the HTML and in turn the CSS. The CSS now half the code it was originally and the JavaScript is one fifth of the original code.

3. The last big change I made was to the amount of languages to choose from. The original project had Chinese and Spanish as the only options. I decided to make use of all 93 languages available and built a dropdown containing them.

### Minor Technicality
My motivation on this was to show a working copy with a link to the exact code and commits. This is and isn't completely that. This is my code and it is running what you see in the link. It isn't for the repository you are reading this from. Github is complicated, to put it simply. I reworked the whole thing only to discover that Github wouldn't let me link a running version from the new repository it is in. So, I copied my new code to the old folder to make it work. I didn't want you to think I was trying to trick you, if you took the time to look that deep.

Thanks for understatnding,
